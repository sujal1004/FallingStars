# FallingStars
This project represents an endeavor in game development using Python with the Pygame library.
It served as the culminating task during my summer internship at Utkarshini-Edutech in 2022.

The game involves multiple stars descending from the top to the bottom of the screen, and the player's objective is to accurately click on the RED star on each occasion. Successfully clicking on the star increments the total number of stars by one, with each star adorned in a random color. Additionally, the game intensifies as the stars' speed escalates with each level.

To enhance the amusement of the game, various code segments can be integrated, such as star swapping, which challenges the player further by interchanging star positions.
